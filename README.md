# Parallel Multi-Layer Neural Networks
 This project forms a comparative analysis of three different MLNN implementations:
 1. Sequential Numpy/Python
 2. Parallel OpenMP/C++
 3. Parallel Eigen/C++

All programs were written by me for the CS445: Machine Learning final project.
Accompanying datasets were not included due to Github size restrictions.
